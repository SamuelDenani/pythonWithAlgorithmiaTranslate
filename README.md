Python translate with Algorithmia Google Translate algorithm
============================================================

This is my first python algorithm and I wanted to try using [Algorithmia Google Translate](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/translation/GoogleTranslate) algorithm.

You can use it by installing the Algorithmia module using  
`pip install algorithmia`  
and creating a file `credentials.json` with your api key named as `apiKey`.
